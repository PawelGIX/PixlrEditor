How to install
==============

Just place files in site/modules/PixlrEditor/ folder and install PixlrEditor module. After that each FieldtypeImage field should have buttons to image editors.

You can enable/disable chosen image editor in PixlrEditor module settings:

Available editors:

- Pixlr Express
- Pixlr Editor


Probably works well with inputfield Repeater.

WARNING
==================

Not tested with Thumbnails module.
I have not tested yet on localhost.
